Things to fix as of 7/21 7:30 pm: (Ana)

- So far all I did was the HTML and CSS markup
- I still need to do JavaScript
- Switch from login to register doesn't work (yet) I still need to fix those bugs
- When you click register at the top, it should switch and show User ID, Email ID, and Password but I made that stuff hidden in the CSS file (for now)
- Create the actual log in system in PHP
- Create database (learn MySQLi)
